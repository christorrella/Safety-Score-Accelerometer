## About
This app is designed to help you reduce the number of hard braking events that are triggered by your car's IMU.
## Usage
The Accelerometer tab shows the current accelerometer data from this iOS device. When decelerating in your vehicle, this device will play a tone and display a color based on the settings set in the Settings tab below.

Note that this device must be placed flat on the center console with the screen facing the sky and the charging port facing the trunk. Disable your ringer silencer switch on the side of your iPhone to hear the tones.

Orientation is important to reduce acceleration error. For best results, park your vehicle on a completely level surface, and then affix your phone to your vehicle in the same orientation described above, also completely flat and level with respect to the level ground.
## Why
The second highest weighted factor behind Forced Autopilot Disengagement in the Predicted Collision Frequency is Hard Braking. I saw a good amount of people online concerned with knowing how quickly they were decelerating, so I decided to whip this up real quick to show how quickly you're actually decelerating.
